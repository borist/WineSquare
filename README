This is where super awesome useful notes go about WineSquare once we're done creating it.

Easy things that we still have to do:
	1. create blank profiles for new users
	2. link logins to actual, corresponding profiles
	3. finish frontend (create wine pages, individual badge pages, profiles, etc)
	4. get all the backend working/ make links correspond to correct pages

Things we MUST do in order to fulfill minimum requirements:
	1. add search capabilities (in our cases, for both users and wines?)
	2. need Delete for CRUD. i guess we could have users able to delete their profiles?
	3. some sort of intelligence - we could either do recommendations OR something with location? aka when people check in we keep track of where it was that they checked in from (I'm not sure how location == intelligence?)

Cool things to (try to) do (and not forget):
	1. Autocomplete for search
	2. friends? could also make adding Delete for CRUD more appropriate
